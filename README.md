# time-sheet

A way of recording hours worked per week

# Installation

Create a new directory that contains punchCard.txt, log.txt, sumHours.hs, and timeSheet.hs. 

# timeSheet.hs

The time sheet file prompts for the user for the hours worked in a week. Each week starts with on a Monday. Running timeSheet.hs prompts the user for the number of hours worked that week that have not already been logged. During the week this data is stored in punchCard.txt. At the end of each week the hours worked that week are written to the log.txt file. 

# sumHours.hs

This returns the total number of hours worked and the average number of hours worked per week.
